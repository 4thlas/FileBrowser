H채mis is a small, but aggressive three-legged critter that group together and can deal a moderate amount of
melee damage.

H채mikset are often found in groups of up to 8 at once.
Their numbers make them annoying to deal with, as their corpses and gold nugget drops will block your shots when they are packed tightly together.
H채mikset will sometimes consume corpses. They also spawn from nests, usually located in the Fungal Caverns. Like other enemies spawned from nests, they drop no gold.
They are also spawned from breakable pots in the Pyramid and Temple of the Art.
Since they are often found in packs, using explosive barrels and boxes to kill them is a good way to get money at the beginning of your run, as trick kills will yield double gold.
Due to their low health, fire from dropped lanterns is also effective for this, as they will jump in panic while ignoring you.
Charmed H채mis are summoned from Chilly eggs when broken.
