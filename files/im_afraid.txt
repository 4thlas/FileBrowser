Sister Calderón: We’ve all lived bad lives, Mr. Morgan. We all sin… but I know you.
Arthur: You don’t know me.
Sister Calderón: Forgive me, but… that’s the problem. You don’t know you.
Arthur: What do you mean?
Sister Calderón: I don’t know… whenever we happen to meet, you’re always helping people and smiling.
Arthur: I had a son… he passed away. I had a girl who loved me… I threw that away. My momma died when I was a kid, and my daddy… well, I watched him die. And it weren’t soon enough.
Sister Calderón: My husband died a long time ago. Life is full of pain. But there is also love, and beauty.
Arthur: What am I gonna do now?
Sister Calderón: Be grateful that for the first time, you see your life clearly. Perhaps you could help somebody? Helping makes you really happy.
Arthur: But… I still don’t believe in nothin’.
Sister Calderón: Often, neither do I. But then, I meet someone like you, and everything makes sense.
Arthur: Heh… You’re too smart for me, Sister. I guess I… I’m afraid.
Sister Calderón: There is nothing to be afraid of. Take a gamble that love exists, and do a loving act.
