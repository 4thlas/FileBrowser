Some ants of the species Colobopsis explodens commit explosive suicide to protect their colony. When threatened, these "exploding ants" contract their abdominal muscles so hard that their bodies rupture, releasing a sticky, toxic yellow goo that smells like curry and immobilizes or kills the attacker.

This goo is actually produced in hypertrophied glands in their bodies, and the explosion often tears them in half — it’s basically a kamikaze move for the greater good of the nest. Researchers discovered this in the forests of Borneo, and yes, the smell was weirdly pleasant.
